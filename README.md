#Project Of Doom design helper

Project based on: [react-mobx-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/rokoroku/react-mobx-typescript-boilerplate)

The Project of Doom was a 2011 Harry Potter Quilt rebooted in 2015 as a Quilt Along for 
[Fandom in Stitches](http://www.fandominstitches.com/2015/07/harry-potter-bookcase-quilt-along.html). 

It is composed paper piecing blocks, designed by 
[Jennifer Ofenstein](https://sewhooked.com) and the 
[Fandom in Stitches](http://www.fandominstitches.com) quilting community.

This project is meant to help the design of the quilt. 
I transformed all of the weekly blocks and most of the supplemental blocks and created this web app
to help with designing a PoD quilt. 

This is very much a work in progress, done in my spare time.

Any suggestions or feedback are welcome.

Here are some examples of what you can do with this.
